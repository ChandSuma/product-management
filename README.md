# Product Management (CS 5093)

This studio-based course helps students learn about and develop product management (PM) skills by putting those skills immediately to use in the context of their Startup Studio projects.

In each session, students learn about a different aspect of product management, product design, or technology development, then practice applying it to their Startup Studio projects, working in the Studio with their project teams, and with the help and critique of the practitioner instructors and sometimes visiting practitioners.

By the end of the semester, students will have developed and practiced many of the fundamental product management skills required to develop new technology products, and their Startup Studio projects will have greatly benefited from the practice.

Student responsibilities:

* This course is a series of interactive studio-based sessions requiring the full participation of all students.
* In each session, student teams learn about and practice applying a PM skill to their Startup Studio project. 
* In between sessions, student teams complete and/or iterate on artifacts assigned in class. Teams are required to log into the class dashboard weekly and post links to their artifacts in their weekly status report.

Grading:

Artifacts will be assigned as homework each session. The first mention of each artifact is listed in bold in the homeworks below. All artifacts are due midnight before the following session and must be entered in the Artifacts sheet (a link to which you will receive via email). In some cases, instructors will leave comments in the sheet about action items required to bring artifacts to an acceptable level, any of which must be addressed by the subsequent session.

Grades are assigned according to the following:

* Team artifacts (70%)
    * Based on instructor review of artifacts in artifact sheet
* Individual participation (30%)
    * Based on peer feedback
