# Product Management (CS 5093)

This studio-based practicum helps students learn about and develop product management (PM) skills by putting those skills immediately to use in the context of their Startup Studio projects.

In each session, students learn about a different aspect of product management, product design, or technology development, then practice applying it to their Startup Studio projects, working in the Studio with their project teams, and with the help and critique of the practitioner instructors and sometimes visiting practitioners.

By the end of the semester, students will have developed and practiced many of the fundamental product management skills required to develop new technology products, and their Startup Studio projects will have greatly benefited from the practice.

Student responsibilities:

* This practicum is a series of interactive studio-based sessions requiring the full participation of all students.
* In each session, student teams learn about and practice applying a PM skill to their Startup Studio project. 
* In between sessions, student teams write a blog post about the relevance of the PM skills they learned, its effect on their Startup Studio project, reflections on their product development process, and example artifacts of that process (photos of exercises, etc.).

Grading:

In order to earn an A, each team must write a total of seven blog posts (one post for each of the seven sessions), as described above. Attendance and participation are required. Students are allowed one unexcused absence.
